Each distinct theme will get its own landing page.\n\nIdentify the primary keyword for each theme — this becomes the landing page's headline and message match.\n\nStep 2 — Create Landing Pages in clone_ppc Mode\nFor each campaign theme, use create_project in clone_ppc mode:\n- Use the user's existing website as the source URL\n- Set the target keyword as the page focus\n- clone_ppc mode automatically:\n  - Removes navigation (reduces exit paths)\n  - Adds a prominent above-the-fold CTA\n  - Optimizes headline to match the ad keyword\n  - Adds trust signals (testimonials, badges, guarantees)\n  - Removes footer links that distract from conversion\n\nWait for each project to generate before proceeding.\n\nStep 3 — Review and Customize\nUse get_website_studio_project to retrieve each generated page. Present previews to the user. For each page:\n- Confirm headline matches the ad group's primary keyword\n- Confirm CTA text and button placement\n- Confirm contact form or conversion element is visible above the fold\n- Confirm trust signals are relevant to the campaign theme\n\nStep 4 — Publish\nAfter user approves each page, use publish_project to make it live. Record the published URL for each landing page.\n\nStep 5 — Connect URLs to Campaigns\nPresent the user with a mapping table:\n| Campaign Theme | Keywords | Landing Page URL |\n|---|---|---|\n\nInstructions for the user: Update the Final URL in each Google Ads ad group to point to the corresponding landing page URL.\n\nStep 6 — Quality Score Checklist\nFor each landing page, verify against Google's Quality Score factors:\n- Keyword appears in headline\n- Page load speed (recommend checking with PageSpeed Insights)\n- Clear relevance between ad copy and landing page content\n- Single conversion goal per page\n- Mobile-optimized layout",

Include a mix of:\n- Offer posts (highlighting the promoted service)\n- What's New posts (product/service updates)\n- Event posts (if applicable)\n\nStep 3 — Add AI-Generated Images\nFor key posts, use ai_generate_post_image to create on-brand visuals. Present images to the user for approval.\n\nStep 4 — Review and Approve\nPresent all generated posts to the user.
